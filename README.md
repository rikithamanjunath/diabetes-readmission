## About

This project uses feature selection and model selection techniques on UCI's diabetes readmission [dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Diabetes+130-US+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008#).

## Data source

This [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/diabetes+130-us+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008) is from Virginia Commonwealth University and contains medical data for 101766 diabetes-related patients across 130 U.S. hospitals from 1999 to 2008. There are 49 features which include demographic, medical history, laboratory test, and medication prescription data. The response variable looks at the patient's post-intervention **readmission**: 1) no readmission, 2) readmitted within 30 days, 3) readmitted after 30 days.

Attribute descriptions of the dataset can be found in [this](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2014/781670/) publication.
